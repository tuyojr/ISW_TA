Why Java?

It enables users develop and deploy applications on the internet for servers,
desktops computers, and small hand-held devices.

- It is a general purpose language.
- It is an internet programming language.
- It is high level language.
- It is an object oriented language.
- It is an interpreted language.
- It is a platform independent language. This means that it can run on any operating 
    system with any machine architecture. It is called a platform because it has two
    components: the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the Java Application Programming
    Interface (API). The JVM is the interpreter that runs the Java program. The API
    is a large collection of ready-made software components that provide many useful
    capabilities, such as graphical user interface (GUI) widgets. Java Runtime Environment
    (JRE) is a software package that contains what is needed to run a Java program. It
    includes the JVM, the API, and other supporting code. The JRE is part of the Java
    Development Kit (JDK). The JDK is a software package that contains what is needed
    to develop Java programs. It includes the JRE, an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler
    (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc), and other tools needed
    in Java development.
- It was developedd by Sun Microsystems (now a subsidiary of Oracle) in 1995.
- James Gosling is known as the father of Java. It was named "Oak" before Java.
- JRE is only meant for running your application.
- JDK is for development purpose which also includes JRE.
- Components of JDK: JRE, JVM, Java compiler, Java archiver, Java documentation generator.
- JRE is the component of the JDK that allows you to run Java programs.
- JVM is the component of the JDK that interprets the compiled Java bytecodes and executes
    them as actions or operating system calls on the host operating system.
- Java compiler is the component of the JDK that translates Java source code into Java bytecodes
    and stores them in files.
- Java archiver is the component of the JDK that packages a set of Java bytecodes into a single
    file.
- Java documentation generator is the component of the JDK that generates documentation from
    Java source code.

- The garbage collector is a part of the JVM. It is responsible for freeing up memory by removing
    objects that are no longer referenced by any part of the program.
- Objects can be unreferenced in two(or 3) ways:
    1. The object's reference variable is assigned null. e.g. Employee e = new Employee(); | e = null;
    2. The object's reference variable is assigned another object. e.g. Employee e1 = new Employee(); | 
        Employee e2 = new Employee(); | e1 = e2;
    3. By anonymous object. e.g. new Employee();
- In Java every object is a child of the class Object. This means that every object inherits the
    methods of the class Object. The methods of the class Object are called the object's inherited
    methods. The inherited methods are: clone(), equals(), finalize(), getClass(), hashCode(),
    notify(), notifyAll(), toString(), wait().
